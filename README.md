# Meowthic NFT

I am a little bit late to play around with NFT, but as I was always curious about going through the wholew process of creating NFT from scratch. Here is my MEOWTHIC NFT.

## Deploying to Anvil
To play aroud:
```
forge install
<run anvil in a separate terminal>
forge deploy
forge mint
```
`Interactions.s.sol` script will deploy all 6 puking cats to Anvil.
Just import the first test wallet from Anvil, add Anvil to Metamask, and then you can import these NFTs one by one. Their ids are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 respectively.

Not sure why I did this. I guess, for fun only. Here is the result in my Metamask:
